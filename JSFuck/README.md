## JSFuck

An esoteric style syntax for javascript with only 6 characters. Can be run in a browser or with Nodejs.

<br />

The given example in `hello-world.js` is javascript equivalent to `alert('Hello, world!')`.

Hence, don't try to run it in Nodejs. It simply won't work. Open the `index.html` file in a browser and you can see the alert.
